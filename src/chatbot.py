BASE_CORPUS = """The Texas Disaster Information System (TDIS) is a comprehensive data platform for natural disaster management in Texas. It aims to streamline the ingestion, storage, processing, and utilization of disaster-related data, focusing on improving natural disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation efforts across the state.

TDIS addresses the current challenges of fragmented, poorly maintained, and inaccessible disaster data in Texas by centralizing and organizing this information. This helps overcome limitations faced by responders, planners, and researchers in effectively supporting disaster resilience.

Key Features:
1. Centralized Data Management: TDIS consolidates disaster-related data from various sources into a single, accessible platform.
2. Real-time Monitoring: The system provides up-to-date information about ongoing disasters and emergency situations.
3. Data Analysis Tools: TDIS includes tools for analyzing disaster patterns and impacts.
4. Resource Coordination: Helps coordinate disaster response resources across different agencies and organizations.
5. Public Information: Provides accessible information to the public about disaster preparedness and response.

Common Disaster Types in Texas:
1. Hurricanes and Tropical Storms
2. Flooding
3. Wildfires
4. Tornadoes
5. Severe Thunderstorms
6. Drought
7. Winter Storms

Emergency Response Resources:
1. Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM)
2. National Weather Service
3. Local Emergency Management Offices
4. American Red Cross
5. FEMA

For immediate emergency assistance, always call 911 or your local emergency services."""
