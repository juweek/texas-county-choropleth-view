More storms are expected to form today,\nwith a particular focus near the Gulf coast. Lower on the coast,\nnearer Matagorda Bay, previous heavy rainfall and flooding means\nthat rainfall will convert to runoff and potential flooding very\neasily. Farther up the coast, especially east of Galveston Bay,\ntoday's storms may produce very\nheavy rainfall, creating a flooding threat there as well.\n\n* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be\npossible.\n\n* WHERE...A portion of southeast Texas, including the following\nareas, Bolivar Peninsula, Chambers, Coastal Galveston, Coastal\nHarris, Galveston Island, Inland Galveston and Southern Liberty.\n\n* WHEN...Through this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,\ncreeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.\nFlooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",

More storms are expected to form today,\nwith a particular focus near the Gulf coast. Lower on the coast,\nnearer Matagorda Bay, previous heavy rainfall and flooding means\nthat rainfall will convert to runoff and potential flooding very\neasily. Farther up the coast, especially east of Galveston Bay,\ntoday's storms may produce very\nheavy rainfall, creating a flooding threat there as well.\n\n* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be\npossible.\n\n* WHERE...A portion of southeast Texas, including the following\nareas, Bolivar Peninsula, Chambers, Coastal Galveston, Coastal\nHarris, Galveston Island, Inland Galveston and Southern Liberty.\n\n* WHEN...Through this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,\ncreeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.\nFlooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",

More storms are expected to form today,\nwith a particular focus near the Gulf coast. Lower on the coast,\nnearer Matagorda Bay, previous heavy rainfall and flooding means\nthat rainfall will convert to runoff and potential flooding very\neasily. Farther up the coast, especially east of Galveston Bay,\ntoday's storms may produce very\nheavy rainfall, creating a flooding threat there as well.\n\n* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be\npossible.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of south central and southeast Texas, including\nthe following areas, in south central Texas, Coastal Jackson and\nInland Jackson. In southeast Texas, Brazoria Islands, Coastal\nBrazoria, Coastal Matagorda, Inland Brazoria, Inland Matagorda and\nMatagorda Islands.\n\n* WHEN...Through this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,\ncreeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.\nFlooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",
