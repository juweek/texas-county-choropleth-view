Flooding may occur\nin poor drainage and urban areas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...\n- The next round of showers and thunderstorms is expected to\npass through the region late tonight and Thursday morning.\nThough the band of storms should be moving at an average\nrate, upper level conditions are favorable for some training\nand regenerating storms. Several inches of rain in a short\ntime period appear to be possible where this occurs. Model\ntrends have shown the axis of heavier rainfall shifting south\nwith each subsequent run with the latest suite showing deeper\nmoisture advection and low level convergence setting up near\nthe houston metro and southwestern counties. Watch area has\nbeen expanded by a generous amount to cover the evolving\nflood threat and uncertainty still present in short range\nforecast models.\n- http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood",
